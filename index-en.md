"I can't remember their names..."

"What was the present she gave me?"

"How come I forgot his advice..."

Remembering people's matter is a great sign that you care about them. There are people who remember things about you, and you appreciate it. On the contrary, not remembering things about others is a bad sign, even if you truly care about them.

Memorio can help you with this. This is a note app suitable for keeping the good memories of the people around you.

It's your diary for your important relationships. For example, this app can help you to keep notes about things you talked about with your family and friends. The more you remember, the more you will enjoy conversations with them.

You can group information by using groups and tags. Examples of groups include "work" and "school", while examples of tags are "gifts" and "anniversaries".

You don’t need to worry about backing up your data, because it’s stored in the Cloud. Add and edit notes from multiple devices through your Apple or Google accounts securely.

This app is not a social networking app. There are no "friends" or "share" functionalities. You can keep notes about your important relationships without worrying about other people's opinions.
